sealFx: Seal - Free Sound Effect

All of my sound effects are original and I make completely by myself from scratch! I do this so that everyone can use them in their videos without fear of copyright! Technically, that makes them all public domain! Using a sophisticated mic, I record my voice and the world around me, then edit them in studio grade software for efficiency and quality.

Feel free to use the sound as you wish! And don't be afraid to show off your videos in my discussion tab using the effects! We love to see your creations!

Though credit for using my sound effects is not required, it is very much appreciated!
