# TNT Cat

## Description

Animal Rush is a platform game created by TNT Cat, where the player, each level, is a different animal. The goal of the game is to reach their shelter safely. We hope you enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed making it! 

If you are a penguin, remember to collect as much icecubes as possible to make your igloo bigger! And if you lose health, eat some fish to recover. Watch out for the seals and the eagles.
